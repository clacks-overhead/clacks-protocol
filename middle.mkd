While IP-SFS [](#RFC4824) makes it possible to transmit Internet protocols
over semaphore signaling systems such as Clacks, the reverse is not always
the case. Information sent in the overhead may be lost when Clacks messages
are sent using HTTP.

This document specifies HTTP headers for transmitting overhead messages
that originate or are intended for Clacks towers.

## Syntax Notation

This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of [](#RFC5234)
and includes, by reference, the "token", "word", "OWS", and "BWS" rules and
the #rule extension as defined within Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4 of [](#RFC7230).

# The Clacks Protocol

Clacks is a semaphore signaling system invented by Robert Dearheart. It is the primary means of communication between city-states along The Grand Trunk. Like most protocols Clacks has a Header (called the Overhead) and Payload. The Overhead contains information about (among other things) source, destination, message detail, logging, and mechanism control. This document doesn't define the Clacks protocol, only it's delivery over HTTP. The Clacks protocol definition is owned by The Grand Trunk Semaphore Company, Ankh Morpork.

# Clacks over HTTP

The Clacks-overhead header field is used to transmit overhead messages in an
HTTP response or request.

ABNF:

    Clacks          = 1#clacks-overhead
    clacks-overhead = clacks-code [ RWS tower-address ] RWS value
    tower-address   = token
    clacks-code     = 1*codechar
    codechar        = ALPHA
    value           = value-string / quoted-string / ext-value
    ext-value       = "=" charset "'" [ language ] "'" value-chars
                    ; like [](#RFC5987)

## Examples

# IANA Considerations

The 'Clacks' and 'Accept-Clacks' header fields have been added to the
"Permanent Message Header Field Names" registry defined in [](#RFC3864).

# Security Considerations

This document represents an extension to [](#RFC7230) and all security considerations therein, or in documents updating or replacing that document, also apply to this one.

# Proxy considerations
Since all Clacks messages are effectivly point-to-point transmissions there is very limited scope for multiple User-Agents to require the same message. Due to this any message with the Clacks-overhead header MUST be considered equivalent to the no-cache header defined in [RFC7234](#RFC7234) Section 5.2.1.4 this allows for the cache to store the object as long as it is revalidated prior to sending.

# User-Agent considerations
A user-agent should follow the Grand Trunk Clacks standards. For example any User-Agent recieving a Clacks-overhead message with a U code should respond to the server with the same Clacks-Overhead header on it's next request.

ToDo: Needs more detail or deleting. It feels a little redundant as it's just referring out...
